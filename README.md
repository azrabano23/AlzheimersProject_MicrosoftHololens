# 🧠 Reverie – Immersive AR/VR Experience for Alzheimer's Support  
🚀 Built for Microsoft HoloLens using **Unity**, **C++**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Over **55 million people worldwide** live with dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form.  
> 🌍 *According to the WHO (2023), Alzheimer’s cases are expected to triple by 2050.*  

Current cognitive therapies lack engagement, personalization, and emotional resonance. Traditional memory care methods fail to fully stimulate patient memory recall or support families in preserving shared experiences.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Reverie

**Reverie** uses immersive **AR/VR storytelling** to help Alzheimer’s patients relive meaningful life events and strengthen cognitive function.  
Users and caregivers can upload **media files (images/videos)** and tag them with context, which are then rendered as **interactive memory bubbles** within a **3D HoloLens environment**.
